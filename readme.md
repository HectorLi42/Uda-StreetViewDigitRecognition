implement a basic LeNet using tensorflow

** network structure **
conv - relu - maxpooling - dropout, - conv - relu - maxpooling - dropout, - fully connected - fully connected - 

Successfull train this model on SVHN dataset, format 2

「以上」

** need to do tomorrow
* Rewrite temperary code into a better-looking style
* apply the same network structure to MNIST dataset, upload result to Kaggle
* Find a way to use the trained model on SVHN format1
